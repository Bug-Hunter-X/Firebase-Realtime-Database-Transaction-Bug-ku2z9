# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The bug involves incorrectly handling the `currentData` object within the transaction, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect data updates.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to update data within a Firebase transaction.

## Bug
The bug lies in how the `currentData` object is handled. Incorrectly attempting to access properties directly, such as `currentData.value`, can lead to incorrect value updates if the data structure is different than expected.  The solution provides the correct implementation.

## Solution
The solution directly addresses the problem by correctly manipulating the `currentData` object, which will handle various data structures correctly without causing unexpected errors.
